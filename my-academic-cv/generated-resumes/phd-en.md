> Suggested additions: GPA/rank, key courses (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Probability & Statistics, Optimization).

## Research and Project Experience

### Crack Segmentation Research and Showcase System (Core Project)

- Investigated key challenges in road-crack semantic segmentation, including class imbalance, fine-detail loss, and generalization limits.
- Built an end-to-end pipeline that combines research outputs with structured web-based presentation and deployment materials.
- Implemented a project showcase website to communicate problem framing, methodological insights, and deployment workflow.

### AI + Web Engineering Practice

- Continuously worked on integrating AI outputs with web systems for better reproducibility and communication.
- Developed and maintained a personal site with dynamic modules (time, weather, online quote APIs) and reusable front-end components.

### Technical Documentation and Knowledge Consolidation

- Maintained experiment logs and method comparisons to support reproducibility and iterative research.

## Publications

- [Title], [Venue], [Year] (submitted/published)

## Academic Activities

- [Talks / posters / competitions / lab services]
- [RA/TA experiences]

## Skills

- Programming: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- Vision/ML: semantic segmentation practice, model evaluation, visualization workflows
- Engineering: Git/GitHub, static deployment (e.g., Cloudflare Pages), technical writing

## Statement of Purpose (Short)

I aim to study robust visual segmentation in real-world scenarios, with special attention to small-structure recognition, distribution shift, and research-to-deployment transfer. I value both scientific rigor and practical system building, and I hope to develop impactful research topics and publications during my PhD.
